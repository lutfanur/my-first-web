  <h3>What I Bought</h3>
  <p>I make and work with a lot of people wanting to start travel <span style="font-weight: bold;">websites</span>, finding something versatile that was quick to deploy with minimal knowledge of code, was crucial.

    There are a few platforms where you can share maps, and travel stories easily. Some of them <span style="font-weight: bold;">specifically</span> built just for travel bloggers which are really awesome, as you can share your stories, connect, and log your trips a lot easier.
    
    The most common website platforms were; WordPress, Wix, Blogger, Tumblr and Weebly, but I found more than 20 when I was looking.</p>
